# 💸 Personal Expense Tracker (AI-Powered Internship Task)

An interactive **Expense Tracker App** built as part of my AI/ML Internship task.  
It allows users to enter **daily, weekly, and monthly** expenses, and provides a detailed breakdown with **visual insights** (pie chart, bar chart, histogram).  

👉 Built in **Python + Streamlit**, with a fallback **CLI version** for terminal lovers.
